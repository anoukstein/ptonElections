Princeton Elections

## Goals

Create an app for district vote counters to quickly upload their counts to the muni website. This will allow for quick unofficial vote counts to get out to the public.

### Current To Do List

* Get election year (anoukstein)
* Get machines from db (anoukstein)

Related to being able to have semi-live updates to data viz as data is getting entered:

* Add a checkbox to mark a district as complete/ready for export => only include these districts in export file (anoukstein??)
* Add data viz map to show for which districts data has been entered (k1rst3n)
* Add text in data viz to show that data entry is in progress (k1rst3n)
